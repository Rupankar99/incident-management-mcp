Send a Slack alert to the #incidents-critical channel for team visibility.\n\nHowever, due to the critical severity and customer-facing nature of this issue, which is causing revenue loss, I have decided not to create a PagerDuty incident at this time. This is because the outage is currently affecting many users (implied by the error rate of 1.0) and has the potential for significant revenue impact, but it does not meet the criteria for truly critical issues that require immediate attention outside of business hours.\n\nAdditionally, I do not believe waking up engineers at this time would be necessary, as the issue appears to be related to a complete outage rather than an internal tool failure or a confirmed security breach. The recent logs indicate a critical error rate and a database connection pool exhaustion, which suggests that there is a significant underlying issue that requires attention.\n\nBy sending the Slack alert and creating the Jira ticket, I am ensuring that the team is informed of the incident and can provide visibility on the status of the outage, while also allowing for a more thoughtful response to address the critical issue."
